# Predictive-Modelling-Multi-Class-Logistic-Regression-Analysis
The project developed a multi-class logistic regression model for weather prediction using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn. It conducted EDA, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables. Multiple feature sets were engineered, and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, MSE, and AUC-ROC metrics.
