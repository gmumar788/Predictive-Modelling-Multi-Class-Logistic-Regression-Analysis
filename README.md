# Predictive-Modelling-Multi-Class-Logistic-Regression-Analysis
The project developed a multi-class logistic regression model for weather prediction using Pythonâ€™s scikit-learn. It
conducted EDA, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables. Multiple feature sets were engineered,
and model performance was evaluated using accuracy, MSE, and AUC-ROC metrics. Visualizations like line plots
and ROC curves were employed to interpret results. Language Used: Python Python Libraries: NumPy, pandas,
scikit-learn Data Visualization: Matplotlib, Seaborn
